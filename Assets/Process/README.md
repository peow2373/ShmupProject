I knew that for my game, I wanted to create something that was continuously enjoyable to play. I wanted to create a game that got sufficiently challenging without ever reaching the point of being impossible.
With that goal in mind, when brainstorming ideas for games, I focused primarily on finding a thrilling and interesting mechanic.
I ended up settling on two major ideas:

The first idea is a turn-based game where the move the player chooses only happens 2-3 turns in the future. 
This is definitely a more strategy oriented game, with enemies coming in fixed, repeating patterns that the player must predict.
I thought of adding special features like a timeline to help players keep track of what will happen next, along with what has happened in the past.
Although I liked this concept, I kept coming back to my second idea...

My second idea is where the player plays as a samurai named Butterfingers. You must run around the side-scrolling arena-style map, slicing enemies with your katana, but here's the catch.
Everytime you swing your sword, you can't grip it tight enough and it flies away and becomes a bouncing projectile that can hurt the player or one of the enemies. You get a new sword everytime, but the more you swing your sword, the more deadly projectiles you create.
My vision for this game is for it to evolve into a bullet-hell style of game as the player continues to kill enemies and increase their score.

I can't stop thinking about my samurai sword game, so I have decided that that is the idea I am going to pursue further. My biggest challenge when creating this game is going to be play-testing enough to achieve the right level of balance between skill and challenge.
