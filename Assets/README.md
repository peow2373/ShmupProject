Hello, and thank you for checking out my game "Just Swinging It." When I had first envisioned creating a new game within the classic Shoot 'em' up genre, my instant thought was to create a game that didn't involve shooting.
I wanted my game to have similar gameplay elements to classic Sh'm'ups, such as: the goal of achieving a high score without set levels, the bullet-hell style gameplay, and the limitations on what controls you were given. 
When brainstorming themes for my game, I was attracted to the idea of playing as a Samurai, who skillfully wields a sword and only swings when it is tactically the best option. 

The entire focus of my game revolves around this mechanic, where the only move the player has is to swing their sword, but there are a wide variety of possible outcomes from that one action. 
There are endless waves of ninjas chasing the player, and since the player is faster, it is possible to round up a good amount of ninjas, cleaving them all with a single swing. This is a satisfying, yet boring mechanic on it's own, so here's the catch:
Everytime the player swings his sword, his butterfingers cause him to lose control, launching the sword around the map as it's own deadly projectile. Luckily, the player has an infinite number of swords, but the more you swing to attack an enemy, the more swords you create.
It's risky to have swords flying around the map, not only because they can strike the player too, but also because the enemies can catch the swords, becoming stronger and harder to kill.
I love this concept of "creating your own challenge" where the game is only as difficult as the player chooses it to be, depending on how many times they swing their sword.
I've designed this game to be replayable multiple times. Implementing a high score system provides visual feedback that encourages the player to try even harder to beat their previous score.
I hope you enjoy playing this game, and see how high of a score you can get!
